## What is Olgax POS?

**Olgax POS** is a fast, touch-friendly, fully offline-capable Point of Sale system built by [OLGAX](https://olgax.com). It is designed to be good enough for real small businesses to use daily — for free, forever — while remaining extensible into a full-featured SaaS platform.

- **Self-hosted** — run it on your own server with Docker in minutes.
- **Offline-first** — uses PGLite (Postgres WASM) to record sales even with no internet, then syncs automatically when connectivity returns.
- **Globally configurable** — change your business name, logo, colors, currency, and tax settings from the UI.
- **Open source** — MIT licensed. Fork it, extend it, run it.
